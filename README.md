# odyssey

A mobile travel companion app tailored for you, by Patrick Wei and Harry Xu.

## features

A user can manage a list of trips, each with a name, start location, and end location. Each trip can be further organized into
different containers (suitcase, backpack, etc), each with a list of items that can be managed. 

New items can added to a container manually, through a picture using YOLOv8, or added automatically based on the container name, current items,
destination location & weather, and personal preferences.

Odyssey also provides a travel mode as a easy-to-use way to keep track of all the bags and containers brought along for the trip.
